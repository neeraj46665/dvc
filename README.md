# ML Project

This is a simple machine learning project using DVC to manage the pipeline.

## Project Structure

- `data/raw/`: Raw dataset files.
- `data/processed/`: Processed datasets after preprocessing.
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Source code for each pipeline stage (preprocessing, training, evaluation).
- `results/`: Evaluation results and metrics.
